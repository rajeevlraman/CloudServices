## Cloud Services

Hey,

Cloud services are becoming increasingly robust and are seen as the future for many small and medium-sized businesses. They offer cost-effectiveness and easy management, with built-in redundancy features that enhance reliability. Most providers offer trial subscriptions and provide credits for learning and experimentation, which I've utilized for my labs. If you haven't already, you should consider taking advantage of these opportunities.

I'll update with screenshots and processes over time. Currently, there are significant changes happening within Microsoft, and transitioning isn't straightforward, especially with the complexities of licensing. Working with trial versions adds an additional layer of challenge.
